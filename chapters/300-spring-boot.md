> Go to "Spring Initializr" and generate a new project:
> - Group: `ro.msg.learning`,
> - Artifact: `shop`,
> - Dependencies: `Web`, `JPA`, `Flyway`, `PostgreSQL Driver`, `Lombok`.
>
> Extract the generated `zip` file into the previously cloned repository. Import this project into your IDE. You can delete the `mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd` and `.mvn` files / folders as you have Maven in the IDE anyway.
